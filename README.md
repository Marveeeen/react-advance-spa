# REACT ADVANCE SPA

This repository contains a simple web application built using React and React Router DOM. It serves as a practical example for studying and understanding how to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using React Router DOM.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Vite, React, react-router-dom
A simple website build with [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) for initial folder structure, [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) for front-end and react-router-dom for routing our application

## Functionality

The web application demonstrates basic CRUD functionality using React Router DOM. It includes the following features:

- Create a event
- Read/display existing events
- Update an existing event
- Delete an existing event

The application provides a simple user interface for performing these actions. By studying the code and components, you can gain a better understanding of how React Router DOM is utilized to manage the routing and implement CRUD operations.

## Lessons Learned:

- loader in createBrowserRouter
- best practice of handling fetch data with loader
- best practice of handling actions using react-router-dom
- proper error handling
- proper nested pages with loader
- React router dom hooks (useNavigation, useError, useLoaderData, useRouteLoaderData, useSubmit)
- React router dom utility (json, redirect, defer)
- React router dom component (Form, Await)
